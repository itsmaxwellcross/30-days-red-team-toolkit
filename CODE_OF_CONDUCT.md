## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including but not limited to:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions, wiki)
* Project Discord server or chat platforms
* Project social media accounts
* Email communications related to the project
* In-person or virtual events representing the project
* Any other forums or platforms where community members represent the project

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, unethical, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email:** conduct@30daysofredteam.com  
**Alternative:** security@30daysofredteam.com

**For security vulnerabilities in the project itself**, please use our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

When reporting, please include:

* Your contact information
* Names (real, usernames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Your account of what occurred, including:
  - When and where it happened

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We will:

* Keep reporter identity confidential unless disclosure is required by law
* Not publicly discuss details without permission
* Only share information with those necessary for investigation
* Protect against retaliation

### Investigation Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: Report receipt acknowledged within 24-48 hours
2. **Initial Review**: Community leaders review the report
3. **Investigation**: Gather additional information if needed
4. **Determination**: Decide if Code of Conduct was violated
5. **Action**: Take appropriate enforcement action
6. **Follow-up**: Check in with reporter about outcome

## Enforcement Guidelines

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, promotion of unethical practices, or sharing malicious content.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. Also includes promoting illegal hacking activities, sharing tools for malicious purposes, or serious ethical violations.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Enforcement for Security Violations

Given the nature of this project, additional enforcement measures apply for security-related violations:

### Immediate Removal

The following will result in **immediate and permanent ban** without warning:

* **Distributing malware** or malicious code through project channels
* **Sharing credentials or stolen data** obtained illegally
* **Encouraging or assisting illegal hacking** activities
