"""
Discord C2 Framework – The Meme Channel That Owns Networks
Uses Discord webhooks, bots, and message reactions as covert channels
Perfect for Gen-Z targets, contractors, and “secure” Slack-alternative shops
Defenders monitor Teams/Slack → nobody monitors the #memes channel
Real attackers already do this. Today you weaponize it.
